# RevenueManagement
Consulting simulation helping a Container leasing company with leasing strategies to optimise the revenue. Following is a quick brief.

Warwick Container Group (WCG) is a leading container leasing company with 75 branches across Europe and 30 in the US. In a competitive and price-driven market, WCG seeks to differentiate itself through superior service quality and value-added offerings. As competition increases, the company is exploring the use of revenue management (RM) techniques, inspired by the success of the airline industry, to optimise pricing and capacity utilisation. However, RM is new to WCG, and there is internal scepticism about its potential.

This project focuses on assessing the applicability of RM within WCG's operations, using data from a UK branch. The proposal will examine RM's potential benefits, such as improving profitability and efficiency through enhanced pricing strategies, while considering challenges like seasonality, container type, and the complexity of one-way bookings. Key performance metrics include load factor and return on investment (ROI). The analysis will offer WCG management insights into the RM methodology, highlighting its advantages and limitations.
